This plugin lets your search pattern be specific to 
that buffer. This is especially handy when one 
works with multiple windows and wants different
search pattern highlighted in different windows.

Normally  if you do :/abc in one window, all other
windows will also highlight "abc".
Now by using this plugin you can do
:Bs abc    which will highlight "abc" only in that
window.  Likewise you can have multiple search
pattern highlighted in different windows.

Side Effects: This plugin will unset hlsearch option
